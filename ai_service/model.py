"""
FerryCast Route Cancellation Predictor
=======================================
Uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on synthetic maritime safety data
to predict whether a ferry departure will be cancelled based on real-time
weather and marine conditions.

The model considers 8 environmental features and outputs a cancellation
probability along with confidence metrics.  Training data is generated to
mirror realistic patterns observed in Southeast Asian ferry operations
(monsoon season spikes, calm straits, rough open sea, etc.).
